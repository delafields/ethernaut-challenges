If you don't get the `MeaningOfLife()` bit/can't read the comment, go read The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

The goal here is simple, write some EVM bytecode that sends **42** to `whatIsTheMeaningOfLife()`. If you've never interacted with EVM opcodes, I highly recommend going through [evm puzzles](https://github.com/fvictorio/evm-puzzles) or playing with [evm codes](https://www.evm.codes/).

It's also probably worth reading this challenge's author's post on [deconstructing a Solidity contract](https://blog.zeppelin.solutions/deconstructing-a-solidity-contract-part-i-introduction-832efd2d7737) to understand what's happening under the hood.

To solve this one we're going to have to get super shadowy and write some [Yul(https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.9/yul.html)] ðŸ˜Ž.
